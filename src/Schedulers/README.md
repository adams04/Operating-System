To run this file we just need to write the following commands For my specific case
gcc -o ../../bin/task1_hw5 task1_hw5.c
As we do this in src files Schedule directory we need to go to the bin file and run the executable file there
cd ../../bin
./task1_hw5


this is for my specific case otherwise we just do

gcc -o           task1_hw5 task1_hw5.c
./task1_hw5
